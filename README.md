# 📝 To-Do List Application in Python

A simple command-line **To-Do List** application built using Python. This project demonstrates essential concepts such as user input handling, file operations, list management, and modular programming. It allows users to manage daily tasks by adding, viewing, marking, and removing them—with persistent storage using a JSON file.
